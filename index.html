<h1>Everyday Journal</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Design Statement</h2>
The journal app will be for people who want to get into journaling, but have a hard time with it. The most commonly stated problems for journaling is accountability and not knowing what to write. The journal will provide random prompts for the journal entry if the user needs it. There is a feature to add friends on the app, in which friends can see whether someone has inputted an entry that day to keep each other accountable. 

<h2>Design Solution</h2>
    <h3>Persona & Scenario</h3>
        Tess <br>
    <ul>
        <li>27 years old, woman</li>
        <li>Engaged, about to married later in the year</li>
        <li>Owns a successful clothing brand/online store, ~96,000/yr</li>
        <li>Originally from Missouri, moved to New York last year</li>
        <li>Technologically savvy, on her phone a lot</li>
        <li>Has wanted to get into journaling for a while, but doesn’t really like writing aimlessly about her day - so she has never stuck to it regularly</li>
        <li>Wants some sort of accountability to get her to stick with journaling</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Scenario #1</h4>
    Tess moved out to New York last year when her clothing brand started getting successful, even though at the time she did not know anyone in New York. She’s been slowly figuring out her life in the city with her fiance and meeting new friends. She went to a meeting today about a potential brand partnership with a major retailer that could elevate her clothing line to a more mainstream demographic. Later that evening, she meets up with the girl friends she’s made in the past year as they celebrate Tess’s potential big career move. When she returns home, she feels very grateful for the new opportunities, new life she’s found in New York, and a great fiance to come home to. She opens her journal app and clicks on Monday, May 6th. She clicks to start writing in her entry when she realizes she doesn’t quite know what to write. Tess clicks on the thought bubble icon and the question of the day says, “What are the top 3 things today you are grateful for?” Tess writes, “the risky move to New York last year, my new friends who are incredibly supportive, the potential new opportunity to work with a major retailer”. She goes on to elaborate for about 15 minutes, chooses her emoji feeling of the day, saves the entry, and then puts her phone down to get ready for bed. 

    <h4>Scenario #2</h4>
    Tess and her friends back home in Missouri have decided to all start journaling. They used to use a text group chat to keep each other accountable, but it has gotten complicated and people keep forgetting about it. Tess moved out to New York last year and some of her Missouri friends have moved out to different states as well. They remain committed to trying to keep up with journaling, so they download the Everyday Journal app. Tess has a crazy schedule one day, in which she has to pitch her clothing brand to several major retailers all in one day. She has been stressed and busy all day. When she finally comes home, Tess unwinds by opening her Everyday Journal app, clicking on May 6th, and writing her journal entry. Tess chooses an emoji that represents how stressed out she was today. Her friend, Julia, checks the friends list and sees that Tess has entered a stressed out emoji for the day, but cannot see her journal entry. Julia texts Tess to check in on her and they catch up about how their week has been so far.

    The prototype seems to follow most of the heuristics, except for the help and error ones. It does provide some instructions for error prevention, but does not have an error message or page dedicated to letting the user know exactly what the potential problem might be. The prototype also does not have a help page. There are no step-by-step instructions or troubleshooting page to help guide the user through potential problems.
